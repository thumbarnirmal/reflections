How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I looked and the bug caught my eye!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can undo changes easily!

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually choosing is subjective whereas automatically saving doesn't give
you freedom of choosing time to save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because they are made for different usage purposes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log is used to see what was done in the commit while git diff is used to 
check the difference between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It makes me confident because I can return to any previously working version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For some open source project I'm thinking of contributing to.
