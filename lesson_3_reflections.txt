When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Remote repo could be used when more than one person are working on the
    project. Also it makes sharing project easy.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Automatic pulling could lead to conflicts as code we are working on might
    get buggy because of the pulling of changes someone else has pushed.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork can be used to get a copy of someone's repo to our github account.
    Clone is used to make a clone of a repo either locally or from github to
    our computer.
    Branch is used to track changes while working on different features for
    the same project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If last known state of remote is available locally, it can be compared
    with our current work and it can be merged locally and later pushed to
    the remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without git or github I would probably use mail to share code. Sharing
    would be easier as no aditional knowledge of commands is required, but
    managing projects, merging, finding conflicts, etc. would get harder.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Whenever I am not sure about the feature I am trying to incorporate in the
    project or when I am just experimenting something, that would be a good time
    to use branching.
